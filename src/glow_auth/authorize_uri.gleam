//// A builder to generate an Authorization Uri.
////
//// In Authorization Code flow, they'll be redirected with a "code" in the uri,
//// which is short lived (10 minutes expiry recommended) that must be exchanged
//// for an Access Token separately.
////
//// In Implicit flow, they'll be redirected with a access token details
//// directly encoded in the uri.
////
//// In both cases, you can send over a `state` which will be sent back to you
//// on the redirect.
////
//// Failure is represented by the fields:
////  * error - set to one of:
////     * invalid_request
////     * unauthorized_client
////     * access_denied
////     * unsupported_response_type 
////     * invalid_scope 
////     * server_error 
////     * temporarily_unavailable
////  * error_description - optional human readable
////  * error_uri - link to a 'more info' page
////  * state - the exact value previously specified in the authorization Uri
////
//// The exception is if there is a problem with the Redirect Uri, like not set,
//// or not registered in the Authorization provider, in which case the redirect
//// back will just not occur.
////
//// Some requirements:
////  * MAY have query component
////  * MUST NOT have fragment component
////  * MUST use TLS
////  * MUST support GET method
////  * MAY support POST as well
////  * Params without value MUST be same as omission
////  * No repeat params
////  * MUST include response_type, typically json
////
//// Note that when redirected, the response:
////  * MUST include the "code" for AuthCode, or the "token" if Implicit
////  * MUST return error if response_type is missing or misunderstood
////  * MAY have query component
////  * MUST NOT have fragment component
////  * SHOULD use TLS for "code" or "token"
////  * Typically are registered in advance of usage
////  * Receiving response SHOULD NOT do js, but redirect again without exposing creds
